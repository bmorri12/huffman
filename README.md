# Huffman​ Encoder

this project contain the HuffmanNode, HuffmanTree, and adjusted BinaryHeap classes
with the detailed methods.that are the solution for Huffman​ ​Encoder​ ​Part​ ​1:​ ​Building​ ​a​ ​Huffman​ ​Tree

## Huffman​ ​Encoder​ ​Part​ ​1:​ ​Building​ ​a​ ​Huffman​ ​Tree

we will implement an efficient scheme for compressing a text
message called Huffman coding. A simple method to encode text as a string of 0s and 1s is to
represent each character as a unique string of 8 binary digits (bits). A text message is thus
translated into a string of bits. By exploiting the fact that not all characters appear with the same
frequency in the text, we can encode rarely used characters with long codes and frequently
used ones with short codes.

In part 1, we’ll use a given a set of characters and their corresponding frequencies to create an
optimal coding scheme: a special binary tree where the path to each leaf represents a different
character. In part 2, we’ll take a text file and, using a Huffman Tree, encode/decode its
message.

## Huffman​ ​Encoder​ ​Part​ ​2:​ ​Encoding/Decoding

In this two part assignment, we will implement an efficient scheme for compressing a text
message called Huffman coding. A simple method to encode text as a string of 0s and 1s is to
represent each character as a unique string of 8 binary digits (bits). A text message is thus
translated into a string of bits. By exploiting the fact that not all characters appear with the same
